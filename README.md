Problem 1

Declaration of initial variables
Loop through the values of set_a
Loop through the values of set_b
check if the integer of set_a is not equal to the integer of set_b
if not equal, add the value of set_a to the value of sum
running cod eto check set_b through set_a
Loop through the values of set_b
Loop through the values of set_a
check if the integer of set_b is not equal to the integer of set_a
if not equal, add the value of set_b to the value of sum

Problem 2

Part 1
Getting the product of V1 and V2

Declare variables
BEGIN
If the length of V1 is equal to v2 it would run else it would skip
It would run a loop through the vectors to multiply them by themselves
After multiplying the values, add it to the value of ps
Write out PS

Part 2
Check if the product is orthorgonal

- Loop through vector pairs to check for orthogonality
- Ensure a vector pair is not multiplied by itself
- Call procedure to get dot product of 2 vector pairs
- if vectors are orthogonal, write msg that functions are orthogonal
